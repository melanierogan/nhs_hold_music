# NHS hold music
Save our NHS - Chill to some music while you wait to book or manage your covid jab or booster jab appointment

## What is this?
A chrome extension which you can download from here and add as an 'unpacked' chrome extension. 
When you visit the nhs covid jab booking website a pop-up appears, you can then click anywhere on the screen and some hold music plays.

## Why
Nobody loves queues but hold music can give us something else to complain about.

## How do I use it?
- You need to use chrome as your web browser. 
- From Chrome head over to chrome://extensions/from the browser’s address bar and enable developer mode. 
- That activates the “Load unpacked” button to add the extension files. 
- Download this repo, and uploaded the files using the load unpacked button
- Active the extension you've just added
- Go to https://www.nhs.uk/book-a-coronavirus-vaccination/

## What is next?
The bare-bones extenion, as it exists here, is being reviewed for the google chrome extenion store. This could take some time. Improvements will be pushed to this github repo and then to the chrome extension if it passes review.

# Thank you
To all those ace people working in the NHS including the teams taking care of and providing the site and infrastructure to allow us to book jabs.
